# rimago/rpi-kodi

Dockerized [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) with audio and video for the raspberry pi4.

![Kodi screenshot](https://kodi.tv/sites/default/files/page/field_image/about--devices.jpg "Kodi screenshot")

## Features

* fully-functional [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) installation in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container
* **audio** ([ALSA or PulseAudio](https://kodi.wiki/view/Linux_audio)) and **video**
* simple, Raspbian image that adheres to the [official Kodi installation instructions](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_for_Linux#Installing_Kodi_on_Ubuntu-based_distributions)
* clean shutdown of Kodi when its container is terminated

## Host Prerequisites

The host system will need the following:

1. **Linux** and [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com)

   This image should work on any Linux distribution with a functional Docker installation.
   
2. **A connected display and speaker(s)**
       
## Usage
* Create file docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  rpi-kodi:
    image: rimago/rpi-kodi
    container_name: "kodi"
    user: kodi
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
    privileged: true
    devices:
      - /dev/fb0:/dev/fb0
      - /dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
    volumes:
      - /home/pi/kodi/home:/home/kodi
      - "/etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro"
      - "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro"
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    environment:
      - PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1
```
WARNING: it requires the --privileged flag which is risky. Please let me know if you have an idea how to remove it.

 * If you want to have the home directory outside of the container (e.g. /home/pi/kodi/home:/home/kodi) you need to add the following user to the host:

```
   groupadd -g 9002 kodi && useradd -u 9002 -r -g kodi kodi
```
   and make sure this user is the owner of the home directory:
```
   chown -R kodi:kodi /home/pi/kodi/home
```
   
## Kodi-Control
### Kore-App
I am using the Kore-App for Remote-Control:
 * [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kore&hl=de&gl=US)
 * [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/official-kodi-remote/id520480364)

To enable it, you have to enable the Kodi webserver by creating the file 
`/home/pi/kodi/home/.kodi/userdata/advancedsettings.xml` 
with the following content:
```xml
<advancedsettings>
    <services>
        <esallinterfaces>true</esallinterfaces>
        <webserver>true</webserver>
        <zeroconf>true</zeroconf>
    </services>
</advancedsettings>
```

### Local Control
The current configuration does not allow access on keyboard or mouse.
If you want to use them you probably have to mount these devices in the container.
Please let me know if you have figured out how that works.
I am happy to add this to the Readme here.

### IR Remotes
In order to use IR remotes, add this device to your docker file:

```yml
      - /dev/lirc0:/dev/lirc0
```

Then once the container is created, you have to manually launch lircd in the container:

```sh
docker-compose exec  -u root kodi lircd
```
